# Go further with the Mutiny workshop!

One great option to teach yourself Mutiny is to go through the [Mutiny workshop examples](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny/tree/main/workshop-examples).

These self-contained [JBang](https://jbang.dev/) scripts cover the main parts of the Mutiny APIs.

It's a fun and easy way to discover Mutiny!

Check out [https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny/tree/main/workshop-examples](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny/tree/main/workshop-examples) to learn more.
